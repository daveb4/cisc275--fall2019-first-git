1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

The five objects created in the main are an ArrayList of dogs, 3 new Dogs, and a Comparator.

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

The Comparator constructor call is in the Collections.sort call where it overrides the original compare message. The class definition for Comparator is in java.util.Comparator.
